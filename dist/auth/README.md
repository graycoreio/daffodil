# @daffodil/auth
Building and maintaining a model and code for an ecommerce store is complex and mentally taxing. `@daffodil/auth`
provides clear interfaces, models, services, and redux state for the frontend of an ecommerce store so that you don't have to.

The auth module manages the login and registration of users and their corresponding access tokens.

## Installation

```
npm install @daffodil/auth \
    @angular/common @angular/core @daffodil/core @ngrx/store rxjs \
    --save
```
