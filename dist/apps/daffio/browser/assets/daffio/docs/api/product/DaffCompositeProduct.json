It includes one primary product and many accessory \"items\". \nThe composite product items are additional products the customer might want to purchase with the primary product, \nand each item has a number of options from which the user can choose. Composite product items can be optional or required.\nFor example, a toolbox bundle might have a primary product of the toolbox. The items could be a hammer and a screw driver, \nand the options for these items could be two different hammers and two different screwdrivers between which the customer could choose. \nAll of these items could have different prices/discounts/etc which would cause the composite products to have ranged prices.</p>\n\n<div class=\"api-body\">\n  \n\n\n<section class=\"members\">\n  <h2>Properties</h2>\n  <div class=\"members-table\">\n    <div class=\"members-table__header\">Name</div>\n    <div class=\"members-table__header\">Type</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"members-table__header\">Description</div>\n\t\t\t\n<div class=\"members-table__cell\">items</div>\n<div class=\"members-table__cell\">DaffCompositeProductItem[]</div>\n<div class=\"members-table__cell\"></div>\n\n\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n</div>"
