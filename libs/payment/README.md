# @daffodil/payment

`@daffodil/payment` contains the main features required to support payment in an Angular app. `@daffodil/payment` doesn't inherently support any particular payment methods but instead provides base models and extension points that are utilized by other libraries.

See [@daffodil/authorizenet](../authorizenet/README.md) for an example of such a library.

## Installation

```
npm install @daffodil/payment --save
```
