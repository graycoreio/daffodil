# @daffodil/seo

The `@daffodil/seo` library intends to provide services for managing SEO data on the current page, such as canonical URLs, tab titles, and meta tags.

In addition to the services, `@daffodil/seo/state` has effects that will automatically manage adding and removing SEO data as the user navigates around the app.

[TODO]: # (Add reference to state guide)
