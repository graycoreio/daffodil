# @daffodil/order/driver/magento/2.4.1

A Daffodil order driver for interfacing with a Magento backend running version 2.4.1 or higher.

Magento v2.4.1 does not provide support for guest orders in their GraphQL orders endpoint. [graycoreio/magento2-guest-orders-graphql](https://github.com/graycoreio/magento2-guest-orders-graphql) should be used to add support for guest orders.
