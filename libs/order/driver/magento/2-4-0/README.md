# @daffodil/order/driver/magento/2-4-0

A Daffodil order driver for interfacing with a Magento backend running version 2.4.0 or lower.

Magento v2.4.0 does not provide a GraphQL orders endpoint. [graycoreio/magento2-orders-graphql](https://github.com/graycoreio/magento2-orders-graphql) should be used to add support for this until Magento is upgraded to [v2.4.1](../2.4.1/README.md).
