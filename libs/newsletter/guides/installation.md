## Installing with `npm`

To install the newsletter library and its dependencies, use the following command in your terminal.

```bash
npm install @daffodil/newsletter @daffodil/core @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects --save
```

After installing, an ecommerce platform driver needs to be set-up, we highly recommend installing the [In-Memory-Web-API](#in-memory-web-api) for fast, out-of-the-box development.

## Installing with `yarn`

To install the newsletter library and its dependencies, use the following command in your terminal.

```bash
yarn add @daffodil/newsletter
```

After installing, an ecommerce platform driver needs to be set-up, we highly recommend installing the [In-Memory-Web-API](#in-memory-web-api) for fast, out-of-the-box development.
