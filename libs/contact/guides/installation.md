# Installation

## Installing with `npm`

To install the contact library and its dependencies, use the following command in your terminal.

```bash
npm install @daffodil/contact @daffodil/core @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects --save
```

After installing, an ecommerce platform driver needs to be set-up. We highly recommend installing the In-Memory-Web-API for fast, out-of-the-box development.

```bash
