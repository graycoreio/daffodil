# BYOD (Bring Your Own Driver)

If you would like to bring your own driver, simply write a service that meets the `DaffExternalRouterDriverInterface` from `@daffodil/external-router/driver` and provide it.

## Parsing and Processing URL

The `url` passed to the `resolve` method can and will have extra info such as query parameters, fragments, and leading slashes. Drivers should take care to parse the passed URL into a form that can be resolved by the platform.

Additionally, URLs returned by the driver's `resolve` method should be in a form that satisfies Angular's [`Route#path`](https://angular.dev/api/router/Route) type. Generally, this means that the url should not have leading slashes or other info such as query parameters or fragments.

### Example

```ts
@Injectable({
	providedIn: 'root',
})
class MyCustomExternalRouterService
	implements DaffExternalRouterDriverInterface {
	resolve(url: string): Observable<DaffExternallyResolvableUrl> {
		// Your logic would go here
		return {
			/**
			 * The URL that will be used for the path of the route inserted
			 * into the Angular routing config.
			 * Should not contain URL fragments, query parameters, or leading slashes.
			 */
			url: "test.html",

			/**
			 * The type of the route
			 */
			type: "SOME_VALUE";

			/**
			 * The HTTP status code for the resolvable route.
			 */
			code: 200;

			/**
			 * Additional route data. Note that this is not mandatory or guaranteed,
			 * its only available when the driver makes it available.
			 */
			data: null;
		};
	}
}

@NgModule({
	providers: [
		provideDaffExternalRouterDriver(MyCustomExternalRouterService),
	],
})
class AppModule {}
```
