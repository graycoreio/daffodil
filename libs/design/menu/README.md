# Menu
Menu is a small floating panel used to display a list of actions or navigational items.

## Overview
Menus only appear when a user interacts with a menu activator button. They should be used for secondary actions or options where users don't need immediate access to.

## Basic Menu
<design-land-example-viewer-container example="basic-menu"></design-land-example-viewer-container>

## Supported Content Types

### Menu Item
A menu consists of multiple `daff-menu-item`s. Menu items should be used with an anchor or button HTML element.

### Icon
An icon can be added before the content in `daff-menu-item` by using the `daffPrefix` selector.

### Menu Activator
A menu is attached to and triggered by the `daffMenuActivator` directive.
