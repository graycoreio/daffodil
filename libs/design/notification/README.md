# Notifications
Notifications provide a way to display and communicate information related to user actions within a page's content.

## Overview
Notifications are used to display short messages that provide context in close promixity to a piece of content. They're often used to provide feedback or to notify users about an action they performed within a page. Notifications should not be used to display app-level alerts. Instead, use the [Toast](/libs/design/toast/README.md) component.

### Default Notification

## Supported Content Types

### Icon
An icon can be used to give a user a brief overview of what the nofication is about. It can be added before the title and subtitle by using the <code>daffPrefix</code> selector.

### Title
Title gives a quick overview of what the notification is about. It can be added by using the `daffNotificationTitle` selector.

### Subtitle
Subtitle provides additional details about the notification that should be limited to one or two sentences. It can be added by using the `daffNotificationSubtitle` selector.

### Actions
Buttons can be included in notifications to resolve the notification or navigate them to a page with more information. It can be added by using the `daffNotificationActions` selector.

The status color of a notification can be updated by using the `status` property.

### Orientation
Orientation dictates how a notification's content is stacked â€” `vertical` or `horizontal`. Notifications are oriented vertically by default. The orientation of a notification can be defined or updated by using the `orientation` property.

### Dismissing a notification
Notifications are not dismissible by default. They typically persist on the page until a user takes action that resolves the notification.

The close button is hidden by default but can be visible by setting the `dismissible` property to `true`. It should remain hidden if a notification has critical information for a user to read or interact with.

## Accessibility
Notifications with actions or with a `danger` or `warn` status have a `role="alert"` so that it can be announced by assistive technologies. All other notifications have a `role="status"`. Notifications have a `tabindex="0"` so users can discover them while tabbing through a page.
