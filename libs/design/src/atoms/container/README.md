# Container
Container is a basic structural element that can be used to restrict content to a specific width. Containers are not responsible for providing padding or margin.

## Size
The size of a container can be defined by using the `size` property. There is no default size set.

Supported sizes: `xs | sm | md | lg | xl`

| Size        | Syntax | Max wdith |

| Extra small | xs     | 640px     |
