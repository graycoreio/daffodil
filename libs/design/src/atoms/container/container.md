# Container Component

The container component is a basic layout element that can be used to contain layouts or individual components to a fixed width.

The component has `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` variants that are set through the size property.

## Usage

```
<daff-container size="lg">
    <!-- Content here -->
</daff-container> 
```
