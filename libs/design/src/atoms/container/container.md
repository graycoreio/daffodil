# Container
`DaffContainerComponent` is a basic structural element that can be used to restric content to a specific width. Containers are not responsible for providing padding or margin.

## Size
The size of a container can be defined by using the `size` property. There is no default size set.
- Supported sizes: `xs | sm | md | lg | xl`

## Usage
```
<daff-container size="lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</daff-container> 
```
