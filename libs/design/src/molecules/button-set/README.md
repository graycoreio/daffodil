# Button Set (deprecated)

> The button set will be deprecated in v1.0.0 in favor of allowing endusers to determine how a set of buttons should be displayed.

The button set component is used when there are two or more buttons grouped together in a row.

## Usage

```
<daff-button-set>
    <button></button>
    <button></button>
    <button></button>
</daff-button-set>
```
