/**
* @docs
*
* `daff-util` is a utility library that contains common functions,
* mixins and variables that make writing SCSS style-sheets a bit
* easier.
* 
*
* @note You can import this as often as you like, as it only contains SCSS
* variables, mixins, and functions; thus it won't effect your final
* compiled stylesheet size.
*
* @usage
* ```
* @import "daff-util";
* ```
