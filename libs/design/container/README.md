# Container
Container is a basic structural element that restricts page content to a specific maximum width.

## Overview
Container comes with pre-defined sizes that work well with common breakpoints. It's not responsible for providing padding or margin.

## Size
The size of a container can be defined by using the `size` property. There is no default size set.

Supported sizes: `xs | sm | md | lg | xl`
