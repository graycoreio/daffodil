## Switch 
A switch allows users to toggle the state of a single setting.

## Overview
Switches provide a way of toggling between two settings with a visual indicator of the current setting. A label can be added on the left, right, top, or bottom side of the switch. The switch can also be disabled or in a loading state.

## Accessibility
Switches follow the [ARIA Switch design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/switch/).
