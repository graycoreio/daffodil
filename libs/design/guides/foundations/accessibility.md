# Accessibility
Accessible design is imperative to letting people of all abilities navigate and understand our product. We are committed to complying with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) and follow the [Four Principles of Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head) to ensure that `@daffodil/design` is accessible to everyone — including those with sensory, cognitive, or motor impairments.

1. **Perceivable** — The user interface must be perceivable by at least one of a person's senses
2. **Operable** - All interactions in the interface must be operable
3. **Understandable** - Users must understand the information and operation of the user interface
4. **Robust** - Content can be reliably interpreted by a wide variety of assistive technologies and remain accessible as technologies evolve

Outlined below are core accessibility concepts that are encoded, either by hand or strictly enforced code, into the codebase. Further discussions of accessibility are also included in various other guides as appropriate.
