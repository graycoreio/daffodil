// `theme` is a utility library for theming the daffodil
// design library. It contains many useful mixins, functions,
// and variables.

// @note You can use this as often as you like, as it only contains SCSS
// variables, mixins, and functions; thus it won't effect your final
// compiled stylesheet size.

// @usage
// ```scss
// @use '@daffodil/design/scss/theme';
// ```

@forward 'core';
@forward 'theming';

// @daffodil/design components
