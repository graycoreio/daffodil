# Callout
Callout is a versatile component that can be used to easily highlight a piece of content.

## Overview
Callouts can be used multiple times on a page. It's a flexible and extensible component that includes pre-styled content containers. It can be used alongside a product list to highlight a set of products, quickly lay out an accordion, showcase a set of features, etc.

## Supported Content Types
A `<daff-callout>` supports transclusion of any content and includes stylized `icon`, `tagline`, `title`, `subtitle`, and `body` content containers.

### Icon
`[daffCalloutIcon]` is intended for visual or branding reinforcement. It should not be used for actionable icons.

### Tagline
Callout taglines are used by adding `[daffCalloutTagline]` to a `<p>` tag. It's intended to supplement the title by providing a short, memorable description.

### Title
Callout titles are used by adding `[daffCalloutTitle]` to a `<h*>` tag.

### Subtitle
Callout subtitles are used by adding `[daffCalloutSubtitle]` to a `<p>` tag.

### Body
`[daffCalloutBody]` is a wrapper container that can be used to place all additional components and content within a `<daff-callout>` and should only be used once. The body container allows for a ton of control and customization because it's not affected by any of callout's properties and only serves as a wrapping and spacing container.

## Theming
The default background color of a callout is light gray, but it can be updated to one of the supported colors by using the `color` property.

Supported colors: `primary | secondary | tertiary | black | white | theme | theme-contrast`

## Text Alignment
Align callout-specific text with the `textAlignment` property. `textAlignment` will not cascade the alignment styles down to `[daffCalloutBody]` or any additional components or elements that is placed inside of a callout. `textAlignment` is set to `left` by default.

Supported alignments: `left | center | right`

## Compact Callouts
Callouts are available in a `compact` mode, which decreases the overall padding of the callout container to suit UIs that require less negative space. To enable the mode, set the `compact` property on `<daff-callout>`.

## Gridded Callouts
Callouts are flexible enough to support grids within them.
