# Analytics Actions Mapping




**Before going deep down first we need to understand this technical term so Let's begin with the word *Analytics Action Mapping* so you can easily understand rest of the things.**




Analytics action mapping is a way to track what users do on a website or app. It involves defining specific actions that users can take, like clicking a button or viewing a page, and mapping them to analytics events. These events help website owners and developers understand how users behave, what they like or don't like, and how to improve the website or app. By using analytics action mapping, website owners and developers can get valuable insights into user behavior and make the website or app better for users.
