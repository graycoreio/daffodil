# @daffodil/search

`@daffodil/search` contains the main features required to build search in an Angular app. `@daffodil/search` doesn't inherently support searching for any particular entities but instead provides base models and extension points that are utilized by other libraries.

See [@daffodil/search-product](../search-product/README.md) for an example of such a library.

## Installation

```
npm install @daffodil/search
```
