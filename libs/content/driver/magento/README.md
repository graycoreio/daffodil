# @daffodil/content/driver/magento

A Daffodil content driver for interfacing with a Magento backend running version 2.4.1 or higher.

Magento v2.4.1 does not provide support for guest contents in their GraphQL contents endpoint. [graycoreio/magento2-guest-contents-graphql](https://github.com/graycoreio/magento2-guest-contents-graphql) should be used to add support for guest contents.
