# @daffodil/state

The state diagram of a Ecommerce store is a complex web of orders, addresses, carts, customers, products, categories, and many other things. `@daffodil/state` provides a sane redux-store model of these pieces so that you don't have to.

## Installation

npm install @daffodil/state
