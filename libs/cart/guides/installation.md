## Post-Install

After installing, an ecommerce platform driver needs to be set-up. We highly recommend installing the [In-Memory Web API](#in-memory-web-api) for fast, out-of-the-box development.

## In-Memory Web API

Optional, but [great for fast prototyping and development](./drivers/in-memory).

## Magento

Refer to [the Magento guide](./drivers/magento)

## Shopify
