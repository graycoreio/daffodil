# About Daffodil

Daffodil is a client-side framework for building ecommerce stores. It presents a standard set of interfaces with which the frontend application can interact while offering a selection of drivers that communicate with the platform of choice.

## Objectives
Daffodil aims to:
- Provide a strongly-typed set of libraries and component kit to simplify ecommerce store development
- Ease migration between ecommerce platforms by decoupling frontend code from the current platform's API
- Provide a collection of features a-la carte style such that no unused features are unnecessarily imported
- Allow extension and customization such that business-specific features can be supported in a platform-agnostic way

## Architecture
The most common type of Daffodil package has a number of layers that can be visualized like so:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Routing] --> B[State]
    B --> C{Driver Interfaces}
    D[Platform Drivers] --> C
    C --> E[Models]
```
Each of these layers exists as a subpackage of the corresponding feature module, e.g. `@daffodil/cart/state`.
