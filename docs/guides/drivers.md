# Drivers

Drivers act as bridges between an application and its backend, simplifying the integration of different platforms. Instead of needing to understand the specific details of each platform, you can interact with them through a driver. This promotes flexibility in data management while providing a consistent way to communicate with each platform.

This [demo](https://stackblitz.com/github/graycoreio/stackblitz-projects/tree/main/ng18-daffodil-product-driver-switch) showcases an application with dynamic driver switching, which allows product information from different drivers to become accessible from one URL.
