### Explanation of foundation-demo commands.
Daffodil is structured as a monorepo and generated using `nrwl/nx`. We utilize
lerna `lerna` to manage all the child packages that are generated by the repo as
well as install their dependencies when needed. `ng build core` will compile the
`@daffodil/core` into the dist folder which the `foundation-demo` lists as a dependency.

## Developing the example foundation-demo
Generally speaking, you don't want to depend on the source of a project when
developing, as that can cause unexpected issues at build and deployment time.
Yet, there are instances when quick development cycles that don't require a full
rebuild can drastically development efficiency. For this reason, we have opted
to create a secondary project `foundation-demo-dev` which can utilized for rapid
feature prototyping. Do note that this project does not support `lint`ing or
`build`ing, it only serves the internal development team.
