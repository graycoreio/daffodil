<h1 daffArticleTitle>Card</h1>
<p daffArticleLead>Cards are versatile content containers that contain content and actions to convey information about a single subject.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>There are three types of cards: default (filled), raised, and stroked. Cards can contain anything from images, blocks of text, lists, accordions, and other components.</p>

<h2>Basic Card</h2>
<p>The example below is a default, filled card that includes all of a card's pre-styled elements and a fixed width. Cards naturally do not have a fixed width, so they'll be 100% wide by default. The width is changeable with custom CSS.</p>

<h2>Supported Content Types</h2>
<p>A card supports a wide variety of content and includes minimally pre-styled <code>image</code>, <code>icon</code>, <code>tagline</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>content</code>, and <code>actions</code> content containers.</p>

<h3>Image</h3>
<p>Image can be added to a card by using the <code>daffCardImage</code> attribute. It stretches the image to a card's defined width and ensures that its border radius is flush with a card.</p>

<h3>Icon</h3>
<p>Icon can be added to a card by using the <code>daffCardIcon</code> attribute. It's intended for visual or branding reinforcement and should not be used for actionable icons.</p>

<h3>Tagline</h3>
<p>Tagline can be added to a card by using the <code>daffCardTagline</code> attribute. It's intended to supplement the title by providing a short, memorable description.</p>

<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Title can be added to a card by using the <code>daffCardTitle</code> attribute.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>Content can be added to a card by using the <code>daffCardContent</code> attribute and should only be used once. It's a wrapper container that can be used to place all additional components and text content within a card. The content container allows for a ton of control and customization because it's not affected by any of card's properties and only serves as a wrapping and spacing container.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>Buttons can be added to a card by using the <code>daffCardActions</code> attribute. This container will always be positioned at the bottom of a card.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3>Orientation</h3>
<p>Orientation dictates how a card's content is stacked â€” <code>vertical</code> or <code>horizontal</code>. Cards are oriented vertically by default. The orientation of a card can be defined or updated by using the <code>orientation</code> property. Horizontal cards will stack vertically on smaller screens due to size constraints.</p>

<h2>Linkable Card</h2>
<p>Cards can be linkable by adding the component selector to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag. All card types are linkable.</p>

<h3>Theming</h3>
<p>Cards will use the base color of your application to display the default background and/or border color. A card's colors can be defined by using the <code>color</code> property.</p>

<p>Supported colors: <code>primary | secondary | tertiary | white | black | theme | theme-contrast</code></p>
