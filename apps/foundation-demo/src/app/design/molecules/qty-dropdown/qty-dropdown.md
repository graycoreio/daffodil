# Quantity Dropdown Component

## Purpose
The quantity dropdown component is an opinionated UI component
which allows a user to choose a quantity of an item to purchase. 

### Notes
Since generally, users only choose to `<= 10` items, we provide a `<select>`
when the number is `<=10`, and a form input otherwise.
