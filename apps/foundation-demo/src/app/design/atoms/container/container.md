# Container Component

The container component is a basic layout element that can be used to contain layouts or individual components to a fixed width.

The component has `small`, `medium`, and `large` variants that are set through the size property.

## Usage

```
<daff-container size="large">
    <!-- Content here -->
</daff-container> 
```
