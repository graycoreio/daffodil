# WARNING: This code operates in a privileged context.
#####
# We only allow workflow runs from forks that we know are safe via a control
# in the Github UI called "Require approval for all outside collaborators".
#    
# It's a little painful to have to keep clicking the button in the UI,
# but it's generally safer for us (from a security standpoint), 
# while still allowing trusted users to contribute 
# to the project without annoying CI failures.
# 
# We have understood the risk and attempted to handle the concern outlined here:
